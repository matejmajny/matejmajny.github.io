Website

So, i made this website with [Nicepage](https://nicepage.com/) and also it isnt nothing pretty, just some basic shit

Plans for future:
1. Add custom domain (probably .tk i dont have money for domains)
2. Update design (maybe, not sure)
3. Update some things how website works (if i will have time)
             
It does have phone version but its weird btw
